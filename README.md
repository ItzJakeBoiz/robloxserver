A simple way of managing roblox ranks

### Commands
- Shout

We have a key built into our systems which require your API to have the key in before anything.
We also have a system that can contact your discord when someone tries to send a request but does so with the wrong key.

### Discord intergration
All things can be logged into a discord webhook of your choice. (this can be turned off)
